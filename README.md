<h1 id="main_head" class="heading_light">About Me</h1>
<h2 id="main_subhead" class="heading_light">My interest</h2>
- The more I take classes at WTCC, the more I realize how truly interested I am in coding and data science. Another one of my interest is actually my job, I build composite plane parts for a living and truly enjoy what I do
<h2 id="main_subhead" class="heading_light">Websites I Recommened</h2>
- [Github] (https://github.com) - Making repositories have been so interesting to me and everytime I do a assignment I just have to show my wife and mom.
- [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com) - The unlimited amount of knowledge on Youtube can keep you not only entertained but interested for hours on end.
